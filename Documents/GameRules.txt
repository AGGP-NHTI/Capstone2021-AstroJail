guards can search players which takes 5 seconds. if they search someone and it is wrong they have to go to an 
ai update center and wait for x amount of time. 
if they do capture a prisoner they get sent to their cell for x amount of time or if someone lets them out.
and they lose all contrand items. these items are placed in a contraband room. item tasks reset and can be redone.  

prisoners- 2 legged humans
prisoners keep all non contraband items

menue for what can be crafted and what is required and where they can get it
